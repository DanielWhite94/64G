# Building
* Clone the directory
* run `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make` from the project directory
* executables will be in the build directory
(note: this is potentially wrong depending on the branch...)

# Sub-projects
* demogen - generates a 'demo' map of a given size (including rivers and towns)
* engine - the game itself (ran with a map file such as a one generated by demogen)
    * Keys
        * Up/Down/Left/Right - move
        * Space - hold to run while moving
        * Tab - zoom out one level (or loop back around to maximum)
        * 'g' - step through grid options (initially no grid, one press gives a tile grid, and the final press also adds a coordinate grid) 
* mappng - takes a map file and outputs a png image of a given size, representing a given region in the map.
* slippymapgen - takes a map and generates a series of files and directories suitable for interactive/slippy maps (these are good for larger maps where mappng can not generate a single image with enough detail).
* slippymap.html - an interactive map implementation which uses the files generated from a call to slippymapgen. 

# Examples #
* Create a demo map 'mymap': ``` demogen 4096 4096 mymap ```
* Create a PNG image of the entire map:  ```mappng mymap 0 0 4096 4096 4096 4096 mymap.png```
* Create a set of tiles for an interactive map: ```./slippymapgen mymap 4096``` (viewing by opening slippymap.html)
* Run the engine: ```engine mymap 3900 2048```
