# Building
From the root directory, run `make clean` followed by either `make release` or `make debug`.

# Sub-projects
* `demogen` - generates a 'demo' map of a given size (including rivers and towns)
* `demogame` - the game itself (ran with a map file such as a one generated by demogen)
    * Keys
        * Up/Down/Left/Right - move
        * Space - hold to run while moving
        * Tab - zoom out one level (or loop back around to maximum)
        * 'g' - step through grid options (initially no grid, one press gives a tile grid, and the final press also adds a coordinate grid)
* `mappng` - takes a map file and outputs a png image of a given size, representing a given region in the map.
* `slippymap` - takes a map and generates a series of images suitable for interactive/slippy maps (these are good for larger maps where mappng can not generate a single image with enough detail). The resulting map can be viewed via the `slippymap.html` file within the map directory.
* `mapeditor` - A WIP GUI editor for maps.

# Usage #
Note: these assume you are in the `bin` directory
* Create a demo map 'mymap': ```./demogen 2048 2048 ../maps/mymap ```
* Create a PNG image of the entire map:  ```./mappng ../maps/mymap 0 0 2048 2048 2048 2048 ../maps/mymap.png```
* Create a set of tiles for an interactive/slippy map: ```./slippymap ../maps/mymap``` (viewed by opening `slippymap.html` in `../maps/mymap`)
* Run the game: ```./demogame ../maps/mymap 940 472```
