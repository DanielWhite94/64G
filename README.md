# Building
From the root directory, run `make clean` followed by either `make release` or `make debug`.

# Sub-projects
* demogen - generates a 'demo' map of a given size (including rivers and towns)
* engine - the game itself (ran with a map file such as a one generated by demogen)
    * Keys
        * Up/Down/Left/Right - move
        * Space - hold to run while moving
        * Tab - zoom out one level (or loop back around to maximum)
        * 'g' - step through grid options (initially no grid, one press gives a tile grid, and the final press also adds a coordinate grid) 
* mappng - takes a map file and outputs a png image of a given size, representing a given region in the map.
* slippymapgen - takes a map and generates a series of files and directories suitable for interactive/slippy maps (these are good for larger maps where mappng can not generate a single image with enough detail).
* slippymap.html - an interactive map implementation which uses the files generated from a call to slippymapgen. 

# Examples #
Note: these assume you are in the `bin` directory
* Create a demo map 'mymap': ```./demogen 2048 2048 ../maps/mymap ```
* Create a PNG image of the entire map:  ```./mappng ../maps/mymap 0 0 2048 2048 2048 2048 ../maps/mymap.png```
* Create a set of tiles for an interactive map: ```./slippymapgen ../maps/mymap 2048``` (viewed by opening slippymap.html)
* Run the engine: ```./engine ../maps/mymap 1000 1024```
